This demo places a desk of toy bricks in front of you that you can interact with. Note that this demo can be used on most Cardboard-compatible headsets. This demo will NOT work as-is on a Samsung Gear VR. See Toy Brick (for Gear VR) instructions below.

You can refer to our [Cardboard Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMGgXu9qwhA) for demonstration.
